# Simple Vue Shop
Check out on  https://project-01-mini-shop.netlify.app

This project was just a fun thing to do, it uses most basic way of implementing Vue inside an HTML website 

  - Components, passing props
  - Reactive variants, images
  - Simple form validation
  - Reviews and reviews tabs
  - events emmiting 
  - Event bus, but please don't do it in more complex projects :)
